Urbit ID is our [public-key infrastructure](/using/id/overview), which is
what allows you to truly own your identity.

### [Overview](/using/id/overview)

This document discusses what Urbit ID is, how it's built, and why it's been
built that way at a high level.

### [Using Bridge](/using/id/using-bridge)

A guide to using [Bridge](https://bridge.urbit.org), our tool for managing your
Urbit ID.

### [Proxies](/using/id/proxies)

You may designate other Ethereum addresses as [proxies](/docs/glossary/proxies)
for your Urbit ID, which are capable of a reduced subset of Urbit ID actions.

### [HD Wallet](/using/id/hw-wallet)

A wallet for your Urbit ID that is accessible with a passphrase called a master
ticket.

### [Bridge Troubleshooting](/using/id/bridge-troubleshooting)

### [Creating an Invite Pool](/using/id/creating-an-invite-pool)

If you own a star, invite pools allow your friends to invite others onto the
network.

### [Guide to Resets](/using/id/guide-to-resets)

What to do when things go very wrong and you need to start over.

## Layer 2

In 2021, [naive rollups](/blog/rollups) were introduced to reduce the cost of
working with Urbit ID and the friction associated with using Ethereum and
cryptocurrency. We have written a series of short guides intended to educate
users of how these changes affect them. For more comprehensive documentation
aimed at developers, see the [Azimuth documentation](/docs/azimuth).
